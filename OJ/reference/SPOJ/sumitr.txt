Note on SUMITR, which was written on 6117 -- Jan 24, 2005:

I got AC at last, with exactly 256 bytes.
Now the prog is hard legible. If you don't know how to solve the prob --
  to find the max sum, I mean, not to compress your prog to 256 bytes --
  don't try to read it. It will just confuse you more :)

Note later: Read sumtrian.pas, which is the same prob but without length
  restriction.
